function dist = oridiff(angle1,angle2)

%pepOriDiff        Returns the difference between the angles in angle1
%                  and angle2 in the orientation domain (that is they
%                  wrap around at pi radians!!!  The angles should be in rad.

w1 = exp(1i*2*angle1);
w2 = exp(1i*2*angle2);
dist = angle(w1 ./ w2)/2 *180/pi

%Another way to do it that I can put in an equation:
%dist = mod(angle1-angle2,pi);
%dist = mod(dist+pi/2,pi)-pi/2;
